## Dopamine Receptor D2 knockout (DRD2) social experiment analysis

### Introduction

This repository holds analysis files used to analyse the data output of several social experiments. These experiments were performed to investigate
Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) knockout mediated social deficits in mice. A social colonies experiment has been performed alongside these social experiments. 
For the code that was used for the analysis of the colonies data, please see [this](https://github.com/VasilisSz/taini_colonies) repository.

The social experiments analysed using this repository are a resting-state experiment, a 3-chamber sociability experiment, and
a 3-chamber social preference experiment.

This repository is structured in a way that it contains a folder for each analysed experiment. Each has its
own README file describing the usage of the analysis files for that experiment:

* [Resting state experiment](resting_state/README.md)
* [Three chamber experiments](3chamber/README.md)

### Experimenters
